## Verification approach
I will only include factual claims that I can verify from primary sources (official documentation, standards, RFCs, or first‑party vendor documentation). Each factual claim will carry a citation. If a claim cannot be verified, I will mark it “Not verified” during drafting and exclude it from the curriculum. For version drift, I will cite the exact page used for each resource and prefer pages that show a version or last‑updated date. If a resource does not publish a date, I will list it as “n.d.” and avoid date claims. When multiple vendors exist for a domain, I will list the major players and justify relevance using their official documentation. Any item without a verifiable, accessible source will be excluded.

## How to use this repo
- Follow the week‑by‑week plan in `curriculum.md`.
- Each week has a folder `week-XX` with your deliverable.
- Use templates in `/templates` for writeups.

## Weekly flow
1. Read the assigned resources for the week from `curriculum.md`.
2. Complete the hands‑on tasks.
3. Write the kata and deliverable in the week folder.
4. Commit weekly artifacts.
```

## Accuracy audit (final gate)
Issues found and corrections
- CI/CD major vendors and official docs could not be verified with citations in this run. Per the hard requirement “No guessing,” they were excluded. This leaves the CI/CD domain under‑represented. Not verified.
- Azure OpenAI documentation could not be verified due to tool call limits. It was excluded. Not verified.

Final statement
“All included claims are cited. Any uncited statements have been removed.”
